## Overview

This Shiny application is designed to facilitate the analysis of non-targeted lipidomics data. It allows users to easily upload alignment result tables generated by MS-DIAL and, optionally, integrate sample class information for further data exploration. The application provides interactive data visualizations, enabling users to inspect lipid species distributions, compare sample groups, and generate pathway analysis diagrams.

Key features include:

- Simple file upload interface for MS-DIAL alignment results
- Integration of sample metadata for enhanced analysis
- Interactive visualizations for exploring lipid species across samples
- Customizable generation of pathway analysis diagrams with Cytoscape desktop app



## Run msdial2cytoscape4lipidomics locally

### Step 1: Clone this repository

Open the terminal and run:

``` bash
git clone "https://github.com/systemsomicslab/msdial2cytoscape-for-lipidomics.git"
```

### Step 2: Bulid Docker image

``` bash
docker build -t msdial2cytoscape4lipidomics .
```

### Step 3: Run Docker image

Run the container on your terminal once it has been bulied.

``` bash
docker run --rm -p 1028:1028 -p 9000:9000 msdial2cytoscape4lipidomics
```

### Step 4: Run msdial2cytoscape for lipidomics in your browser

Open your browser and paste `http://localhost:1028`. 

## Prepare input files
msdial2cytoscape4lipidomics does not accept raw data input. It is highly recommended to use the alignment table processed by MS-DIAL5. This application utilizes the alignment table from MS-DIAL to visualize lipidomics data in Cytoscape.

Additionally, we support a data frame format where lipid molecules are arranged in columns, and sample IDs are placed in rows. In this format, the second row must contain metadata about the samples. 

Furthermore, you need to prepare a CSV file that maps lipid molecules to their respective lipid classes. This file should have lipid names in the first column and their corresponding lipid classes in the second column. 

The file format must be CSV.

Examples of supported data formats can be found in the inst/examples folder.

### Metadata file
In msdial2cytoscape4lipidomics, you can provide sample metadata separately using a CSV file. This metadata file offers detailed information about each sample, which is essential for visualization and analysis in Cytoscape.

Please ensure that the metadata file follows these guidelines:

- Sample IDs must be listed in rows, and they should match those in the alignment table or data frame.
- Sample attributes (e.g., group, treatment condition, time points) should be listed in columns.
- The file format must be CSV.
Using a metadata file allows you to incorporate additional information about each sample, enabling more comprehensive analysis in Cytoscape. Examples of the metadata file format can be found in the inst/examples folder.

## Load data files
![Data upload](inst/www/DataUpload.png?raw=true "Data upload")
1. Select the data file format.
2. Load your data files.
3. (optional) You can also upload metadata files and transcriptome data if needed.
4. Enter a unique project name.
5. Click the "Submit" button to metabolite data and metadata, converting them into a format suitable for analysis.
Once step 4 is completed and , navigate to the Plot Data tab to continue.
